Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \\n\\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room.

Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \\n\\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \\\"shoot pool\\\" time.) The pool was also pretty nice, but when we stayed, it was pretty cold to be swimming. \\n\\nI would love to come back and hope to organize a squad trip for my Potterhead friends.
