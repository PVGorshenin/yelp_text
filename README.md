## Training of Ridge regression

To reproduce a training steps it's necessary to install `run_lr` package of my own origin. 

Use this command 
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/PVGorshenin/run_lr@master
```

Package is rough and redundant, I know it). But for the aim of getting basic score it is enough.

Ridge regression is used with default params. Once again it's just for the basic score.
